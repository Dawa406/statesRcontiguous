Description: Data package containing shapefiles for the US that may easily be restricted to only
    the contiguous US. Shapefiles are provided for; states, congressional districts and counties.
    All shapefiles have the resolution of 1:20,000,000 and are from 
    <https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/tiger-cart-boundary.html> but are augmented with
    additional information from TIGER, see shapefile_details for details.
    Please note, this package is explicitly designed to fit all shapefiles within one CRAN-hosted
    package. You will want to use the tigris package for programmatic access to TIGER.
