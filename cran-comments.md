## Release summary

This is the first release of a package designed to provide a self-contained set of CRAN-hosted shapefiles for the following properties of the US; states, congressional districts, counties. Data processing is self-contained within the /data-raw directory and a parameterised README.Rmd file auto includes the details of the latest version of the shapefiles in the readme. Note that the shapefiles have been augmented with data from additional sources to make it easier for users to subset the shapefiles to concern only the contiguous US.
